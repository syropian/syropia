When sending notifications through multiple channels (say email and SMS), you may want to throttle the number of notifications sent through a specific channel. For example, you could limit the number of SMS notifications sent to a user to 1 per day, and limit emails to 5 per day. I'm going to show you how we can leverage Laravel's `RateLimiter` class to achieve this with only a few lines of code.

## Setting up our notification

First let's set up an example notification class. We'll use the notion of a user favouriting a post as our example. We'll send a notification to the post's author when a user favourites their post.

```bash
php artisan make:notification PostFavouritedNotification
```

In this example we also want to store a copy of the notification in the database. Let's modify the `via` method in your notification class to define two channels — `mail` and `database`

```php
public function via(object $notifiable): array
{
    return ['mail', 'database'];
}
```

Since we're using the database channel, we should ensure we have the table setup in our own database correctly. Fortunately, Laravel provides a migration for this out of the box. Let's run it now.

```bash
php artisan notifications:table
php artisan migrate
```

## Throttling channels

In our example, we want to throttle the number of notifications sent through the `mail` channel to **one** every hour. So how can we do this? We'll lean on both Laravel's event system and its built-in [RateLimiter](https://laravel.com/docs/rate-limiting#main-content) class.

### Listening for notification events

When Laravel sends a notification, it first dispatches a `NotificationSending` event. This event has a special power, and I'll explain it through this excerpt taken directly from the [Laravel documentation](https://laravel.com/docs/notifications#notification-events):

> The notification will not be sent if an event listener for the `NotificationSending` event returns `false` from its `handle` method.

Interesting! This means we can control if this notification gets sent out by simply returning `true` or `false` in an event listener. Let's go ahead and create that listener class now.

```bash
php artisan make:listener CheckNotificationRateLimiter
```

You should have something like so:
```php
<?php

namespace App\Listeners;

class CheckNotificationRateLimiter
{
    public function handle($event)
    {
    }
}
```

Let's type our `$event` argument to be of type `NotificationSending`. We can do this by importing the class at the top of the file, and adding it as a type hint to the `handle` method. We know we're going to return a `bool` here so we'll set that as the return type as well.

```php
// ...
use Illuminate\Notifications\Events\NotificationSending;

class CheckNotificationRateLimiter
{
    public function handle(NotificationSending $event): bool
    {
    }
}
```

This event object has some very useful properties. We can access the notification instance, the notifiable instance, and the channel the notification is being sent through. Let's use this to our advantage.

We know that if the channel is `database`, we always want to send the notification. So we'll return `true` if that's the case.

```php
public function handle(NotificationSending $event)
{
    if ($event->channel === 'database') {
      return true;
    }
}
```

Ok, we can finally set up our rate limiting for the `mail` channel! First we'll construct a unique key that we can use to identify this notification. We'll use the fully qualified class name of the notification, the channel, and the notifiable's ID. We'll use the `implode` function to join these values together with a colon.

```php
public function handle(NotificationSending $event)
{
    if ($event->channel === 'database') {
        return true;
    }

    $key = implode(":", [$event->notification::class, $event->channel, $event->notifiable->id]);
}
```

Next we'll use the `tooManyAttempts` method on the `RateLimiter` facade and pass our key, plus a `maxAttempts` value of `1`. This will return `true` if the user has exceeded the maximum number of attempts. In our case we want to return the negated value of this call, as we want to return `true` if the user has not exceeded the maximum number of attempts.

```php
// ...
use Illuminate\Notifications\Events\NotificationSending;
use Illuminate\Support\Facades\RateLimiter;

public function handle(NotificationSending $event): bool
{
    if ($event->channel === 'database') {
        return true;
    }

    $key = implode(":", [$event->notification::class, $event->channel, $event->notifiable->id]);

    return !RateLimiter::tooManyAttempts(
        key: $key,
        maxAttempts: 1,
    );
}
```

Perfect! So how does the `RateLimiter` know when we've made too many attempts? Well, we need to increment the limiter each time we send a notification. Similar to the `NotificationSending` event, Laravel also dispatches a `NotificationSending` _after_ the notification was successfully sent. This sounds like a great place to do our incrementing as it is queue-friendly and will only run if the notification was successfully sent. Let's create another listener class to handle this event.

```bash
php artisan make:listener HitNotificationRateLimiter
```

Similar to the `CheckNotificationRateLimiter`, we can typehint our `$event` parameter — this time using the `Illuminate\Notifications\Events\NotificationSent` class.

```php
// ...
use Illuminate\Notifications\Events\NotificationSent;

class HitNotificationRateLimiter
{
    public function handle(NotificationSent $event)
    {
    }
}
```

All we need to do now is construct the same key we did in the previous listener, and call the `hit` method on the `RateLimiter` facade. Once again, if the channel is `database`, we don't need to do anything, so we'll return early.

```php
//...
use Illuminate\Notifications\Events\NotificationSent;
use Illuminate\Support\Facades\RateLimiter;

public function handle(NotificationSent $event)
{
    if ($event->channel === 'database') {
      return;
    }

    $key = implode(":", [$event->notification::class, $event->channel, $event->notifiable->id]);

    RateLimiter::hit(
        key: $key,
        decaySeconds: 3600, // 1 hour
    );
}
```

Nice! The only thing left to do is wire up your listeners to their respective events. Go ahead and open up `app/Providers/EventServiceProvider.php` and add the following to the `$listen` array:

```php
// ...
use Illuminate\Notifications\Events\NotificationSending;
use Illuminate\Notifications\Events\NotificationSent;
use App\Listeners\CheckNotificationRateLimiter;
use App\Listeners\HitNotificationRateLimiter;

//...
protected $listen = [
    NotificationSending::class => [
        CheckNotificationRateLimiter::class,
    ],
    NotificationSent::class => [
        HitNotificationRateLimiter::class,
    ],
];
```

Perfect! We've now successfully set up rate limting for our notification's mail channel.

You may be thinking, "Ok great, but how do I configure different limiters for different notifications?". You'll recall that the event object passed from `NotificationSending` and `NotificationSent` has a `notification` property. This is the actual notification instance that is being sent. We can use this to to configure different limiters for different notifications. You could modify the `CheckNotificationRateLimiter` listener to do just that.

```php
// ...
public function handle(NotificationSending $event)
{
    if ($event->notification::class === PostFavouritedNotification::class) {
        if ($event->channel === 'database') {
            return true;
        }

        $key = implode(":", [$event->notification::class, $event->channel, $event->notifiable->id]);
    } else if ($event->notification::class === SomeOtherNotification::class) {
        // return true/false
    }
    // ...
}
```

This will work just fine, but as you may have noticed, it's not very scalable. If you have a lot of notifications, you'll end up with a lot of conditional statements.

## Refactoring to an interface

I think a nice API to handle this would be to define a throttle configuration directly on the notification class itself. Let's build a quick contract class for this method. Go ahead and create a new interface called `ThrottlesChannels`. You can put it in the anywhere you like in the `app` directory, but I'll put it in `app/contracts`.

```php
<?php

namespace App\Contracts;

interface ThrottlesChannels
{
    public function throttleChannels(object $notifiable, array $channels): array;
}
```

We've defined a single method for this interface — `throttleChannels`. This method accepts the notifiable instance, and an array of channels. It should return an array of channels and their associated throttle configurations. Let's implement this interface on our `PostFavouritedNotification` class.

```php
use Illuminate\Notifications\Notification;
use App\Contracts\ThrottlesChannels;

class PostFavouritedNotification extends Notification implements ThrottlesChannels {
    // ...

    public function throttleChannels(object $notifiable, array $channels): array
    {
        /**
         * Throttle the mail channel, so that only one
         * email notification is sent every hour
         */
        return [
            'mail' => [
                'key' => (string) $notifiable->id,
                'maxAttempts' => 1,
                'decaySeconds' => 3600,
            ],
            'database' => false,
        ];
    }
}
```

Here we've returned a throttle configuration that satisfies our requirements. We want to throttle the `mail` channel to one notification per hour scoped to the notifiable instance, and we don't throttle the `database` channel at all. We can now modify our `CheckNotificationRateLimiter` listener to use this method.

Let's clear out the existing logic and start fresh. The first thing we'll do is check if the notification class implements the `ThrottlesChannels` interface. If it doesn't, we'll return `true` to allow the notification to send.

```php
// ...
use Illuminate\Notifications\Events\NotificationSending;
use App\Contracts\ThrottlesChannels;

public function handle(NotificationSending $event): bool
{
    if ($event->notification instanceof ThrottlesChannels) {
      // TODO: Implement me
    }

    return true;
}
```

If our notification does indeed implement the `ThrottlesChannels` interface we first need to get the notification's available channels. We can do this by calling the `via` method on the notification instance. We'll then pass these channels to the `throttleChannels` method on the notification instance. This will return an array of channels and their associated throttle configurations.

```php
// ...
use Illuminate\Notifications\Events\NotificationSending;
use App\Contracts\ThrottlesChannels;

public function handle(NotificationSending $event): bool
{
    if ($event->notification instanceof ThrottlesChannels) {
        $channels = $event->notification->via($event->notifiable);

        $throttleConfig = $event->notification->throttleChannels($event->notifiable, $channels);

        $channelConfig = $throttleConfig[$event->channel];

        if (empty($channelConfig)) {
            return true;
        }
    }

    return true;
}
```

If there is no throttle configuration for a channel, or it's value was set to `false`, we return `true` to allow the notification to send.

We're going to construct a base key to use for the rate limiter, and we allow the key to be extended by passing a `key` property to the throttle configuration. It will consist of the fully qualified class name of the notification, and the channel name.

```php
// ...
public function handle(NotificationSending $event): bool
{
    if ($event->notification instanceof ThrottlesChannels) {
        $channels = $event->notification->via($event->notifiable);

        $throttleConfig = $event->notification->throttleChannels($event->notifiable, $channels);

        $channelConfig = $throttleConfig[$event->channel];

        if (empty($channelConfig)) {
            return true;
        }

        $key = implode(":", [$event->notification::class, $event->channel]);

        if (! empty($channelConfig['key'])) {
            $key .= (string) $channelConfig['key'];
        }
    }

    return true;
}
```

Now all that's left is to grab the `maxAttempts` value from the throttle configuration, and call the `tooManyAttempts` method on the `RateLimiter` facade.

```php
// ...
public function handle(NotificationSending $event): bool
{
    if ($event->notification instanceof ThrottlesChannels) {
        $channels = $event->notification->via($event->notifiable);

        $throttleConfig = $event->notification->throttleChannels($event->notifiable, $channels);

        $channelConfig = $throttleConfig[$event->channel];

        if (empty($channelConfig)) {
            return true;
        }

        $key = implode(":", [$event->notification::class, $event->channel]);

        if (! empty($channelConfig['key'])) {
            $key .= (string) $channelConfig['key'];
        }

        $maxAttempts = $channelConfig['maxAttempts'] ?? 1;

        return ! RateLimiter::tooManyAttempts($key, $maxAttempts);
    }

    return true;
}
```

Now we can pop over to our `HitNotificationRateLimiter` listener and modify it to use the `ThrottlesChannels` interface as well.

```php
<?php

namespace Syropian\LaravelNotificationChannelThrottling\Listeners;

use Illuminate\Notifications\Events\NotificationSent;
use Illuminate\Support\Facades\RateLimiter;
use App\Contracts\ThrottlesChannels;

class HitNotificationRateLimiter
{
    public function handle(NotificationSent $event)
    {
        if ($event->notification instanceof ThrottlesChannels) {
            $channels = $event->notification->via($event->notifiable);
            $throttleConfig = $event->notification->throttleChannels($event->notifiable, $channels);
            $channelConfig = $throttleConfig[$event->channel];

            if (empty($channelConfig)) {
                return;
            }

            $key = $event->notification::class.':'.$event->channel;

            if (! empty($channelConfig['key'])) {
                $key .= (string) $channelConfig['key'];
            }

            $decaySeconds = $channelConfig['decaySeconds'] ?? 1;

            RateLimiter::hit($key, $decaySeconds);
        }
    }
}
```

This is nearly identical to the `CheckNotificationRateLimiter` listener, except we're calling the `hit` method on the `RateLimiter` facade. We're also passing a `decaySeconds` value to the method, which will be used to determine how long the limiter should be active for.

That's it! Beautifully simple notification channel throttling, just by implementing a single interface.
